The OSG-VO-Map package contains two scripts:

===== generate-vo-map =====
This script reads an EDG mkgridmap configuration file, as delivered by
the Open Science Grid Operations Center (OSG GOC) and creates a list
of users that are in each VO: a so-called User-VO map.

This script cannot read an arbitrary edg-mkgridmap file and construct
the VO map, but the GOC has added comments to the file to provide
information about each VO name. There are two names for a VO, referred
to as the "VOC" (the name you would use to look pretty) and the "VOI",
which is usually the all-lowercase version of the VOC. 

This happens with comments in the file. Before a "group" line, there
can be two kinds of comments:

Type 1:
# 2 FermiLab -- Fermilab Grid Support Center (helpdesk-admin@fnal.gov)
group vomss://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/fermilab fermilab

Type 2:
# USER-VO-MAP cdf CDF -- 1 -- Subir Sarkar (subir.sarkar@cnaf.infn.it)
group vomss://voms.cnaf.infn.it:8443/voms/cdf cdf

Note that Type 1 only specifies the VOC, and assumes that the VOI is
the lowercased version of the VOC. Type 2 specifies both the VOI and
the VOC. 

Command-line options:

--input  (Required) The edg-mkgridmap.conf file
--output (Required) The file to put the user-vo-map in. 
         Usually osg-user-vo-map.txt.new
--log    (Optional) Where to print information about what the script
         does. 

===== check-vo-map =====
This script reads a user-vo map and:

1) Eliminates entries that list users that do not exist on the system
   (as determined with the 'id' command-line tool. You might ask why
   this functionality isn't in generate-vo-map. This is because users
   that do not use EDG mkgridmap will not run generate-vo-map but they
   might use GUMS which will create a VO map itself: so this tool is
   independently useful. 

2) Optionally creates a VO list. This is a list of VOs that are in the
   User-VO map. If there are many users in a VO (which is sometimes
   the case when using pool accounts with GUMs), the User-VO map can
   be quite large, and this is a simplification for monitoring tools
   that prefer to use it. 

Command-line options:

--input  (Required) The osg-user-vo-map.txt.new file
--output (Optional) The file to put the user-vo-map in.
         Usually osg-user-vo-map.txt. If not specified, then
         the filename is assumed to be the same as --input
--log    (Optional) Where to print information about what the script
         does. 
--volist (Optional) If present, the file where a list of VOs should
         be placed. See #2 above.
-undefined_ids (Optional) If present, the file where a list of
         accounts that do not exist were removed from the
         user-vo-map.
